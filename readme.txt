This program was was developed using Visual Basic 6.0 and SQL 7.0.  It is designed to be highly reuseable code. It features:

- add and delete users
- database setup screen, which will write to the registry
- create and delete a database table
- insert, view, edit, and erase data form a database table
- load and clear a grid with data from a database table

NOTE:
Before you compile and run this program, you must create an ODBC data source, called "Northwind", attached to the Northwind database, included with SQL 7.0.  You will need to know your database server and the 'sa' password.  When you login into the program for the first time, use 'admin' for the User ID and 'admin' for the password.

The program will create two tables.

tblusers - holds the user logins
dbuser - temp table to insert, view, and edit data.
